# Welcome to My New Jekyll Site

I've decided to transform my website into a Jekyll-powered site to take advantage of its powerful features for building static websites.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll offers several advantages:

1. **Speed and Security**: Static sites load faster and have fewer security vulnerabilities compared to dynamic sites.
2. **Markdown Support**: Writing content in Markdown is simple and efficient.
3. **Version Control**: The entire site can be version-controlled using Git.
4. **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages provides free hosting for Jekyll sites.
5. **Flexibility**: Jekyll allows for complete customization of the site's design and functionality.

## Recent Updates

Recently, I've made several updates to my site:

- Upgraded jQuery from v3.4.1 to v3.7.1 to address security vulnerabilities related to HTML sanitization
- Improved the site's responsiveness for mobile devices
- Implemented better SEO practices

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to improve this site!
